## Extended world selection
This Minecraft mod that allows you to create and load worlds from anywhere on your disk drive.

By default, Minecraft only allows you to save and load worlds in the "saves" directory, where the game's profile is installed.  
What makes things even more complicated is that as of `1.20.X`, Minecraft has implemented restrictions on usage of symbolic links, making it harder to interact with worlds from outside of the "saves" directory ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/13v5xuv)). If you still prefer to use symbolic links, please refer to the [following official Minecraft.net article](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/16165590199181).

With this mod however, you can easily select whichever directory on your disk drive (or an external drive) you wanna work with, and you can freely create and load worlds in those directories. The only requirement is that the operating system itself gives you access to your desired directory, because for obvious reasons, you cannot choose directories you don't have access to.

### Mod usage instructions
Below is a step-by-step guide on how to use this mod:

1. Go to the "Title screen", aka the game's main menu
2. Click on "Singleplayer" to open the world-selection screen
3. Next to the "Search" textbox on top of the screen, there should be a new button with a folder icon on it. Clicking on it will allow you to select another world "saves" directory.
